I own 5 cans now and my arc has been fucking identical to every single other suppressor owner I know. Multical always sort of seems attractive at first glance. But in practice it doesn&#039;t add up. Most probably only have 1-2 actual EDC handguns they really want to shoot a lot with and thus train with, so what&#039;s even the point of something that will be inferior on the gun you use 99% of the time in favor of ones you use 1% of the time (if that)? Once you cover your main calibers the wait stops being particularly annoying, the first really is the worst. And on the scale of gun expenditures $500-1k a handful of times just isn&#039;t much, if you&#039;ve got enough to purchase piles of guns and shoot them you can afford 5 cans, if you don&#039;t buy them or don&#039;t shoot them you don&#039;t need cans for them anyway. So it really does end up being a non-problem.<br><br>There are few people for whom it probably makes sense to have a fallback do-everything-can but that&#039;s after you have covered your main ones and just want a final 1% can.",2023-11-27 23:56:55,Success,normal,0.9976058006286621

Lü Wenhuan, commander-in-chief of the Southern Song dynasty, surrendered to Yuan Emperor Kublai Khan in 1273. The conventional use of Mongol cavalry was restricted by the woody terrain and numerous military outposts of the Southern Song. Chinese firearms and cannons were employed by the Yuan in the victorious siege of Fancheng after capturing the outposts and relieving Southern Song forces from Sichuan and Yuezhou, which broke through the siege but was eventually defeated.

NATO MBTs, like the M1 and its derivatives, are all much better because they were always intended to be individually more costly, but to have a qualitiative advantage. They prioritised turret armour, situational awareness, mobility, and firepower-along with having a more functional microelectronics industry which allowed for more complicated FCS, and situational awareness systems such as thermals and in modern times tank GPS. The soviets went for a light, cheap, easily deployable, but cost effective tank, which prioritised having as low a profile and weight as possible, while trying to fit as much armour and as big a gun as the chasis would allow. The larger NATO MBTs also allowed them to more easily accommodate upgrades over their service life, unlike cramped soviet tanks whose small size severely restricts what they can be fitted with. That and NATO having a much better electronics industry, and the collapse of the USSR devastating industry in Russia.<br>Theres an additional issue of the Russian armour values looking good in theory, at least for the 1980s, but in practice they offered very incomplete coverage, again, due to the small size.

A firearm creates a volume of very high pressure gas in a contained tube, the expansion of which drives the bullet, and most of the sound comes from the gas entering free atmosphere behind the bullet at high speed (a tiny amount comes from the supersonic crack of the bullet itself but not much). A standard suppressor provides contained space for that gas to expand and cool before entering the atmosphere more slowly and over more time vs all at once, which makes it quieter. If a can has more internal volume it has more space to hold all the gas and let it cool.<br><br>In a cylinder centered around the barrel, there is a limit to how much it&#039;s practical to increase the diameter before it&#039;s so high it really interferes with even suppressor height sights or optics. So to get more volume you make the suppressor longer. But in general handguns have a lot more space below the barrel then above in terms of not getting in the way. So a non-cylinder suppressor can have the same internal volume with a shorter length by expanding vertically downwards. Since shorter length can be desirable in handguns that can be a decent trade.<br><br>The other approach to short is to use wet/wipe based designs but those are more irritating to use so still tradeoffs.",2023-11-26 20:43:26,Success,normal,0.9999247789382935

The vast majority of firearms available will feed reliably (all else equal) with 28 in the mag. There’s simply just a lot of tension on that spring. Now, if you’ve got a really solid rifle, well mass regulated, and running smooth, it should strip at least those top two out really well. And yes, when we make the argument for 30 rd mags then EVERY.

60241957,k,60241957,Anonymous,"My PTR has been a lemon but after a long storage I took it to the range along with my Tavor 7 and surprisingly it cycled better than it did before I put it away. Previously it was failing to fully chamber the next round and would do so every 2-3 shots, and with how it chews up cases it was a pretty huge money sink. I would love it if it just ended up being a long break in period but I still doubt that. PTR didn’t respond to my emails so if it doesn’t continue to improve I’ll call and see if they’ll check it out. They have a seemingly bad rep for needing repeated returns of the gun to fix an issue. To take it to a gunsmith would probably cost a small fortune if it ends up needing expensive part replacements. It’s a very cool gun when it works but I’m glad I took a chance on the Tavor 7, that gun is a joy to shoot and will run anything. I’m not even a bullpup fag, I’ve always thought they’re kind of ugly. I would never have given it a chance if the Scar wasn’t so overpriced with an ever increasing price tag. The only thing I’d trade it for at this point would be an HK or maybe a Spear. I don’t know though, once you get used to the compact package of a bullpup, it’s kind of hard to pass up, the Tavor at least is ergonomic as fuck.",2023-11-25 23:08:14,Success,normal,0.9999563694000244

Absolute suppression performance varies way more, but on top of that is a lot of factors involved in the platform you want to use. Semi or manual? Where on the hunting to range toy spectrum? If semi, do you/can you have an AGB? Stuff like that helps you figure out how you need to balance noise vs backpressure, size and weight.

It has a 4.4&quot; barrel, about the same as a Glock 17 gen5 (4.5&quot; barrel) which then has an overall length of 7.95&quot;. Meanwhile the Maxim 9 is 10.75&quot; inches, so the entire gun is only 2.8&quot; longer then a conventional full size handgun. Despite that it suppresses very well, sub-140 with any standard 9mm ammo, all while having a flat top you can use conventional height normal glock irons on. Part of the reason for that is the suppressor stretches way down below the bore so the total volume is still high. Again you can get short cylinders that work, an Aurora 2 is only 3.3&quot; long, but it uses wipes.<br><br>Part of the reason I really hate suppressors being on the NFA is how it kills the market for innovative designs that&#039;d be really nice for suppressing with CC.

However, here is how I&#039;d think of it and then walking through it.<br>1. Performance: handgun round suppression tends to be pretty similar without major asterisks as I said earlier, so this isn&#039;t a huge differentiator. One thing to be cautious of ties in with the next factor size, a lot of cans these days are &quot;modular&quot; where you can have a short and long config. The advertised suppression is always long, and that&#039;s always the only one that is going to be decent. So don&#039;t get fooled by places that highlight both short config length and long config suppression.<br>2. Size: This one varies a lot more, and does matter when tied to performance. Anyone can suppress by just throwing size and mass at it, but a can that suppresses to a given level while also being compact is &quot;punching above its weight&quot; so to speak. A lot of top 45 cans are big, like 8-10&quot;.<br>3. Warranty: &quot;limited lifetime&quot; is table stakes in the US can market imo.<br><br>So going through a bunch of places (AAC, Huxwrx, Resilient) I actually think good ol&#039; SilencerCo and the Omega 45K looks pretty decent. At 6.4&quot; long it&#039;s way way below what I&#039;m seeing from others but still is &lt;140. Decent use rating. The Osprey is longer at 7.9&quot; but that&#039;s still a bit lower then the 8.5&quot; of many others and being officially rated for wet use too was fun back in the day, plus it does look cool. M9 is the only SiCo product I still have, I did not opt for them for any of my new rifle cans, but for 45 they seem worth a look.<br><br>Anyway dunno but hope that helps a little. Good luck anon, first can is always the most painful. Make sure to buy with a trust.",2023-11-27 02:17:11,Success,normal,0.9999402761459351

The little .38 special will take small game easily and makes target practice very affordable, and a .357 magnum out of an 18.5&quot; barrel will easily take deer and coyotes. I can hit an 8&quot; plate at 100 yards with mine, through iron sights or a red dot. It also carries light, and if you practice with it you can shoot almost as fast as a semi (the key factor being, it&#039;ll take practice and in the interim gives Billy time to learn safety and discipline). Such a gun also pairs fantastically with a revolver, and the two together work well going through brush looking for hogs later in life.

PAK-40 could only pen thid glaccis from only like 100-200 meters range. But Soviets tested it with Panther gun and it reduced penetration from like 2500 to 1000 meters.

It&#039;s more that narcos and the like can afford newer plates so 5.56 simply can&#039;t pen that at distance. The Mexican army figured out that most narcos are garbage shots so their doctrine is to pick them off with accurate fire from ranges that battle rifles are effective at. Narcos mostly have AK and AR platform guns in intermediate cartridges and just spray and pray. Most engagements between the Mexican military and narcos are actually in mountainous zones or in hilly fields where battle rifles shine. Also in urban areas NATO 7.62 pens cover better. It&#039;s why they&#039;ve kept the G3 in production. The FX05 was designed to be able to handle larger rounds than 5.56 from it&#039;s onset. The Mexican army actually wanted the SCAR family as their standard rifle way back in the early 2000s but FN wasn&#039;t allowing them to license produce it back then, so they first went with the G36 then built the FX05 as a weird halfway between the SCAR and G36. Now apparently it&#039;s held up because Mexico can&#039;t figure out if they want 6.5 sneedmoor or 6.8 as their future primary cartridge. The lower recoil flat trajectory 40mm grenade launcher is however well into it&#039;s final stages. They use a medium velocity round similar in concept to what the Germans are going to use in their SSW40 grenade rifle.",2023-11-30 11:17:29,Success,normal,0.9999144077301025

Contrary to popular belief, clothing makes or breaks most operations. Tactical clothing (&quot;garment systems&quot; to the tactical professional) enable the warfighter to maintain his readiness posture while reducing stress on the combat chassis. My recommendation? The Crye Precision G3 Combat Pant paired with a First Tactical Men&#039;s Tactix System Jacket. It&#039;s low profile, which helps because I run a &quot;grayman&quot; urban setup as my EDOC (Every Day Outer Carry).<br>Your weapon choice? Honestly, kid, it don&#039;t matter what you&#039;re using, longarm, sidearm, or scattergun, so long as you train. I can&#039;t emphasize enough how many times my reflex training in bleeding edge tactical maneuvers has carried the day, especially in so-called &quot;light ops&quot; (as if that&#039;s ever the case!) Snapshots, daylight-runner drills, trapping-the-keyhole; it&#039;s that focus on the basics that carries the fight. Stress shoots from prone and standing? Okay. Stress shoots while shrimping out of a training partner&#039;s guard? That&#039;s where you build those skills.<br>In all, one warrior to another, you&#039;ll get there kid.

In terms of crew survivability, comfort, tactical awareness it was pretty fucking garbage. Fuel tanks surrounding the crew who were crammed in even more like sardines than in a T-34 with no real ability for the driver to see and barely any visibility for anyone but the commander? Sound awful, but that was so they could cram as much gun and armor onto the thing as possible. And the two piece ammo also blew chunks for tank engagements or any high octane fighting in general but it meant whatever it did hit died. They built about 4000 in the war and lost half of those in combat, so they were hardly some impregnable super weapon, but especially considering they were produced at the tail end of the war not the start, that’s a lot of heavy tanks and quantity of a weapon is important just by itself. As a breakthrough tank it showed obviously decent performance. I think it’s a bit overhyped for what it was, but I wouldn’t say it’s without merit. It also didn’t break down constantly so huge plus. I would make the argument that heavy tanks in ww2 were a mistake on the whole. Breakthrough tanks like the Tiger and IS-2 were good, when used appropriately, which was offensive force multipliers tip of the spear type deals. They were not useful for nor particularly good at defensive engagements on the whole, even if they might have had some favorable k/d’s in doing so. It’s all about resources and opportunity cost, and in a large way the IS-2 was a lot of opportunity cost taken to its extreme. And properly deployed in the time and place when it was most beneficial to do so. I do not think IS-2s would have performed any better than KV-1s in 1941, but they were exactly what the Soviets needed in 1944.",2023-11-30 11:47:39,Success,normal,0.9999022483825684

The Chieftan was slow and expensive though technically superior. The German auto industry also thrived during the cold war because they produced fast well built vehicles cheaper than the English speaking countries did. Mercedes was touted as mass market Bentley/Jaguar; VW was touted as the lower middle class alternative to Ford and French brands.

Would you have a reason to have purely light infantry divisions?</span><br>For among other reasons, lighter units are better for strategic mobility. One of the issues the US Army ran into during the 90s was how long it took to deploy forces overseas. Everyone remembers Operation Desert Storm in 1991, but the US involvement in the Gulf War began with Operation Desert Shield five months earlier. The US&#039; initial objective wasn&#039;t to liberate Kuwait, it was to defend Saudi Arabia. Iraq in 1991 had the world&#039;s fourth largest military, but it was also heavily in debt from the Iran-Iraq War (much of it owed to Saudi Arabia) and Saddam Hussein had begun to denounce the Saudis as corrupt and said they were the illegitimate rulers of Mecca and Medina. The Saudi military was even weaker in 1991 than it is today. If Hussein had decided to invade, he would have controlled 65% of the world&#039;s oil supply. It would have turned Iraq into a major power overnight.<br>The problem was that you can&#039;t move armored and mechanized infantry divisions overnight, even with the US military&#039;s enormous strategic lift capabilities. There was a brief period were we legitimately might not have been able to stop Saddam from rolling into Saudi Arabia.<br>[1/2]",2023-11-30 12:13:40,Success,normal,0.9998637437820435

In 1855, optician William Malcolm of Syracuse, New York began producing his own telescopic sight, used an original design incorporating achromatic lenses such as those used in telescopes, and improved the windage and elevation adjustments.

About 5 years ago there was an idea to make an ATGM simulator. In the process we accounted for all the tricks russians use in their advertisements. And then I got my hands on a trophy Kornet. And as it turned out its magnification is only 10x and not 12x and 20x, like on export variants. The state of its optics was very sad. Even in the manual it was written that the field of view can vary between 5.5 and 8 degrees. When I asked professional optical engineers about that, they told me that the russians don’t have a standardized optical layout and the necessary amount of the lenses to make serial devices of consistent quality with 8° field of view. They use what they have on hand to make sights, resulting in inconsistent field of view. While they can play with the lenses to have the same 10x magnification, there are problems with the field of view. <br>If you look at statistics, the largest number of losses of armored vehicles is still artillery. Then aviation, drones and only then ground-based AT weapons. Of all the anti-tank weapons, including other tanks all the ATGM missiles, like Metises, Kornets, Fagots, Konkurses, here Kornets occupy a very small niche. In the total number of losses, it is less than 10%. Even the Russians themselves say that the quality of those missiles oftentimes is different from expectations. There is also psychological factor. They are now trying to modify Kornets to be remote-controlled and have thermals. Basically, turn it into Stuhna-P. I can see they would want to do that, since when the missile has to fly for 4km at 300 to 310 m/s, the operator is exposed for substantial amount of time. &quot;Kornets&quot; are not the most basic unit. <br>6/x",2023-11-28 23:23:05,Success,normal,0.9998230338096619

With no LRBHO like an AK or HK you either count your rounds or you get a click and no bang to tell you you’re empty (or that you’ve had a malf), having a LRBHO lets the gun tell you you’re empty. Having the gun tell you that you’re empty and then having to do one extra step on the reload like working the charging handle is nowhere near the same as click no bang and then reloading and also having to work the charging handle. But yes I agree that important thing is to discourage people from buying NATO stocks and to bully people who have already bought NATO stocks.",2023-11-28 23:16:17,Success,normal,0.999942421913147

It was $80 at a pawn shop 10 years ago, and I was looking for something cheap to cut down and make a handy long gun that I could beat the shit out of and not worry about it. When I got it, the stock was attached by a single vertical bolt that went up through the stock and into a lug on the action. The wood cracked and failed almost immediately at that attachment point, resulting in the action being jammed backwards in the stock on every shot. This prevented operating the bolt until you pulled the whole barrel and action back forwards. If you look just in front of the magazine, you can see the lighter-colored wood filler where I attempted to repair the stock, and the hole I drilled for a bolt to go horizontally through the stock to stop the action from moving backwards under recoil. <br><br>What ended up happening is that after a few shots, the cross bolt I added just ended up sheering off the welded lug on the action for the factory stock bolt. Now the action had no means of being attached to the stock, so I used hose clamps. It&#039;s under the bolt handle so you can&#039;t see it, but I put in a new cross bolt that goes behind another part of the action that holds the trigger and everything because the hose clamps don&#039;t stop the original problem of the action from getting jammed back into the stock. That was worked since, but I haven&#039;t shot the gun in years. The Rossi lever action took its place as a handy long gun to beat up.",2023-11-29 00:50:53,Success,normal,0.9998866319656372

Rounds such as .270, .308, .30-06, .222, .300 savage, and much more were in commonality. <br><br>But there is one round in particular that stands near the 7.62x39 cartridge: .30-30 Winchester.<br>The .30-30 is one of the first smokeless powder cartridges to sell on the US consumer market. It’s been a mainstay for deer hunters since 1895 and despite being antiquated by modern standards, it’s still a favorite among hunters in dense wooded areas in some parts of the country. The cartridge is said to have killed more deer than any other in the US, and that credence probably rings true considering the amount of lever guns made in it. But it’s not just a levee gun cartridge, it was a popular round for sporterdized surplus rifles and saw some love in pump action rifles, revolvers, and break action pistols such as the Contender. <br>But what’s led this have to do with x39? Well they share similar ballistics, but the .30-30 has the added benefit of greater ammo variety and legality for hunting in certain states.<br>When x39 started to arrive on the market, it was all corrosive steel core surplus and the only guns that shot it were combloc arms not particularly suited for hunting deer or similar types of game. Then there is laws. Each stage has its own laws and regulations for hunting. Many states have capacity limits, caliber limits, ammo restrictions and more. .30-30 had an easier time meeting these regulations back in the day and still does. <br>7.62x39 can’t compete",2023-11-30 06:27:36,Success,normal,0.999885082244873

The largest engagement was something like 5-6 tanks on each side. This is a very rare situation. But if we think about it, the tank was originally devised to be a vehicle that could advance across the multilayered enemy defensive line with barbed wire and anti-personnel mines, since AT mines didn’t exist. And it was originally conceived as an infantry support vehicle, so there were machinegun tanks and gun tanks. But their purpose was to support infantry at the field of battle from the front or the rear, so the infantry could capture the enemy trenches. That’s what they do now, returning to tradition. But in addition to that, they are still used as field artillery. But their semidirect or indirect fire-support role has decreased, due to the nature of fighting and thanks to the fact that we got more dedicated artillery and shells. In addition to that artillery reconnaissance units got saturated with drones, so they function differently to how it’s written in manuals. Nevertheless, tanks are still used in this role, when there is nothing else available, or everything else has run out of shells. Well-trained crews come are able to shoot at 12km.</span><br>This is why I doubt tanks will be obsolete any time soon. The pure direct fire MBT is looking a bit dated, but if you want something that can get right up to the front and deliver a shell to anything within 12km with very quick travel time, an artillery tank hybrid is a really good choice. In 10-20 years they could be doing that even further into the enemy backline by launching remote controlled glide vehicles rather than dumb shells, which would make staying near the front very dangerous for things like SPGs, TOS-1 or air defence. It&#039;d be expensive compared with a normal shell but cheap compared with a missile.",2023-11-29 02:57:49,Success,normal,0.9998745918273926

I think I used an old guitar string for this, which resulted in the hammer spring destroying it after a few minutes and then the spring was no longer captive.

Most people don&#039;t find a shotgun to be comfortable shooting that frequently. <br>If you shoot clays and participate in club or competition skeet, trap, etc. shooting, then you&#039;ll either be using a O/U (or rarer SxS) or a semiauto. If you are hunting ducks, it&#039;s almost always a semiauto now. If you are shooting the 3-gun type competitions, it&#039;s almost always a semi. For upland birds, it&#039;s SxS &gt; O/U &gt; Semi as is customary. Pump shotguns tend to occupy one of three positions among gunowners and shooters: one of the first guns they buy because everybody recommends a pump, their innawoods defensive weapon (you&#039;ll see a lot of mossbergs and 870s up north for polar bear defence), or their home defence weapon. <br>All three situations warrants very little actual shooting of the pump shotguns. They are usable but unsuitable for the other use cases mentioned earlier.<br>Get a Mossberg 500/590/590A1 or a Remington 870 produced before 1994, preferably a nice Wingmaster since they are so smooth and barrels can be changed to whatever length you want with a simple swap. This is just for formality as you want to own a pump shotgun.

For example a bolt is milled out of Carpenter 158 stock. So you decide to run it through an inspection machine but you cannot measure the first and last two inches of the 20 foot bar of raw material so maybe that is scrap or you keep it and that&#039;s on extra bolt per 20 foot section. High quality control throws it away and not so high QC just omits the inspection completely, but the quality of the material is the same either way. In this case you are only losing a single digit % of material, but it adds up. So do tool changes of cutting tools. More frequent = more money. These are economic decisions. It costs more but should it cost twice as much? I don&#039;t think so in this case. What will a defect cost? It is different in every case. It is the difference between having a flat on Saturday on the way to the store or corner 3 at Laguna Seca on MotoGP weekend. Every AR part is critical, but failure is designed to occur where it can be easily fixed in the field. If your life depends on it, $3000 isn&#039;t a lot of money to know it goes boom, but the chance of a failure happening going from 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 150,000 is not going to make a big difference for most. I used to buy precision metal parts in the multi millions and the same companies make AR/M platform parts and ammo, use the same manufacturing, quality lab, and inspection processes. The quality and precision for an AR is nothing compared to a fuel injector and every car has 4-8 of them and they see heat and pressure, and the tolerance is 125th of a human hair so please, let&#039;s not pretend that the high cost of these weapons do not include branding and sales costs not related to performance.",2023-11-24 02:52:24,Success,normal,0.9999097585678101

During the Cold War, the main area of operations for MI6 agents would be the Warsaw Pact countries. They would enter their target countries as merchants or under some diplomatic cover. This means, a real Bond would have been officially working for some MI6 front, who do business with the target country in question. In the movies, Bond was a representative of Universal Exports, which was an MI6 front. He carried a Walther PPK, because it most closely resembled the gun all real MI6 agents would carry.<br><br>Traveling under a cover identity, Bond would cross the border to the Warsaw Pact member states just like any merchant or diplomat. He would have a suitcase and perhaps a briefcase for business documents. When crossing the border, the border guards would carefully open and examine his belongings. There was no way a real Bond would try to smuggle a PPK over. That is an unnecessary risk. Instead, real MI6 operatives would have a local MI6 contact already operating in the country. This is also how the KGB operated in the West. They would have an armorer who would provide weapons and equipment for their operatives. The armorers can only purchase local equipment, definitely not Western products, unlike in the movies, where Bond gets his stuff from a London-based Q.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;tl;dr</span><br>A real Bond would be given a Makarov or PB, not only because they&#039;re the ones the local armorer can easily get, but also because he needs the gun to fire local ammo, and be reliable.

Moved to a big liberal West Coast city (yeah it&#039;s Portland) and spent most of my twenties adhering to pretty liberal politics. Was never outright anti gun, but didn&#039;t think there was any legitimate reason for any private civilian to own anything other than a bolt action hunting rifle or shotgun (maybe a CCW, if they can show cause to need one and get a permit). Following 2016 election, I swung much further left politically. I&#039;ve always enjoyed shooting, but having lived in a city, owning a firearm seemed pointless. But I do spend a lot of time outside, backpacking, camping, exploring BLM land. Started getting back into guns around 2020 due in part to civil unrest here in Portland. Wanted to start off with a 10/22, because, but my partner at the time had irrational liberal biases against firearms. Finally split with her late last year, and bought myself my 10/22 as an early Christmas gift.

Yes it is a solved game no it doesn&#039;t change the utility nor benefits. A modern example of this in shooters is understanding off meta players who exploit in game functions for strategic plays. Case in point most COD players will die in chokes running into fire. Intelligent players will use waves to pick off defenders, use explosives to disrupt entrenched positions or use smoke for cover. But most players aren&#039;t intelligent and literally run in to die.

The bigger the round (especially if it&#039;s rimmed) the harder it is to design a reliable magazine, and the smaller its capacity would be. However, shotgun shells are uniquely fucked in this regard, because there is no universal standard of shotgun shell dimensions that all companies follow. A &quot;2 and 2/3 inch shell&quot; can get quite different from one manufacturer to the next in all of its important dimensions; no one follows the SAAMI standard or anything like this in the way that manufacturers follow it for 9x19 or 5.56. Because you don&#039;t have to with a shotgun using a tube mag and a lifter. But you do in a conventionally magazine-feeding not-rifle chambered for shotgun shells. Which not a lot of people use. Which creates a feedback loop where development, sale and purchase of new magazine-fed shotguns is continuously disincentivized.

Regarding the &quot;fragile&quot; plastic part. The magazine tube is pressed into a plastic piece that is itself inside the aluminum frame. I own multiple 1300&#039;s from the 90&#039;s and I&#039;ve seen retired police trade ins beat to shit with broken off butt plates, worn out springs and no finish. On none of them has that piece ever been broken. It&#039;s sandwiched between other metal parts. I&#039;ve only heard of it on /k/ and while you could break it, like Glocks exploding and SIG&#039;s rusting, it just isn&#039;t the problem that that /k/ makes it out to be. <br>There are 2 problems with the 1300<br>1. The guns are all old and replacement parts are increasingly difficult to find. So if you do break that or any other piece, it&#039;s not as easy to replace.<br>2. The aftermarket is virtually non-existent, unlike with the 870 and 590, both of which have huge aftermarket. This is only an issue if you want to play with different furniture and side saddles.<br><br>Other than that, the 1300 is as good of a pump action as has ever existed. It&#039;s super light and super smooth. Just like an AR, the receiver is aluminum while the bolt rotates and locks inside the barrel. This set up makes the guns lighter and stronger. However, all that said, and to anon&#039;s point, an old gun has parts that can break and be hard to replace. So, you don&#039;t buy one with the intent to abuse it.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Remington 870</span><br>Everyone I personally know that has bought one in the last 30 years had it break immediately.

According to the same report however, Sadat dispatched Task Force 777 from an elite commando unit to Cyprus aboard a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. Cairo merely informed Kyprianou that &quot;people are on the way to help rescue the hostages&quot; and did not reveal who was on board nor what their intentions were.[5] Upon landing in Cyprus, the Egyptian force immediately launched an all out assault, dispatching a single Jeep all-terrain vehicle with three men to race ahead of an estimated 58 troops (another report has this figure at 74[6]) moving towards the hijacked aircraft on foot.</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;As the Egyptian troops advanced quickly towards the hijacked DC-8 aircraft and the Cypriot special forces who surrounded it, the Cypriot special forces (LOK) reportedly issued a single verbal warning to halt and submit, though in other reports, the Cypriots issued two verbal warnings, the second demand for the Egyptians to return to their aircraft. As this occurred, the occupants of the Jeep and the Cypriot operators exchanged gunfire, and the Egyptian Jeep was struck by a rocket propelled grenade (RPG), as well as gunfire, killing all three occupants. As the vehicle came to a halt, the Cypriots and the main Egyptian force confronted each other at a range of less than 300 metres (330 yd), and it is variously reported that the Egyptians, who lacked any form of cover, dropped down onto the tarmac in prone firing positions.</span>",2023-11-25 13:41:04,Success,normal,0.9996846914291382

Even during the AWB, AR&#039;s were common and easily available, and people were putting dots on them. You didn&#039;t see as many flattops back then and most people were rocking A2 handguards, but it&#039;s no great feat to stick an optic on the carry handle.

The take away from that, is that .380FMJ may have too much penetration for your intended purposes, and you&#039;re letting a lot of energy escape out the back of the target, rather than dumping the energy into the target. One reason .380 is popular, is because the reduced recoil of the round enables it to be used in handgun frames that would otherwise be rather unpleasant to shoot if chambered in 9mm or 10mm.

Similarly, if OP doesn&#039;t plan on getting into long-range shooting or hunting (or if he&#039;s hunting in terrain where a shotgun will do the job just fine) then there&#039;s no need to buy a scoped .308 just to tick a box or whatever.

Police don&#039;t want to carry a rifle around in their arms 24/7, it makes them look like the oppressive foot soldiers of a corrupt regime; it&#039;s also heavy, awkward and unnecessary for 99% of the time they&#039;re on the job. A pistol isn&#039;t as effective but it&#039;s better than nothing (especially when the majority of police shootings occur at a range of &lt;15 ft and when they&#039;re free to dump an entire mag at the target). If police really think they&#039;re going to end up in a shooting (or if they think they might be shooting someone from further than the other side of a room) then they&#039;ll get the rifles or shotguns out of the car. The Burmese rebels don&#039;t carry rifles because they don&#039;t have them. They&#039;re using whatever weapons they can get their hands on.<br>When you&#039;re hunting you&#039;re free to choose the weapon you want so you have the luxury to make it an effective one. There&#039;s also the fact that you&#039;re taking shots at much further ranges than the typical officer involved shooting and often in terrain where you can&#039;t mag dump because the deer will have fucked off behind some trees if you don&#039;t get a lethal shot with the first hit. Finally, it&#039;s a matter of ethics, if you&#039;re hunting as a hobby rather than because you&#039;re stuck in the middle of the wilderness and will die otherwise then you&#039;re morally obliged to minimise suffering to whatever animal you shoot (and if you&#039;re some nigger with care for animal welfare then consider that if animals are seen to be suffering then it gives antigunners more propaganda to restrict hunting).",2023-11-26 16:01:25,Success,normal,0.9999022483825684

If one didn&#039;t know any better it makes logical sense that a 9mm should be more powerful than a 5.56mm since 9 &gt; 5. But what&#039;s not being said is that 9mm is a handgun round while the 5.56mm is a rifle round with a lot more gunpowder behind its bullet so you can&#039;t just compare the two bullet diameters. Even within specific kinds of ammunition you can&#039;t make this assumption. For example, take common revolver cartridges. .357 Magnum is significantly more powerful than .45 Long Colt even though .45 &gt; .357 and if you put the two cartridges side-by-side the .45 looks bigger. In this case the underlying reasoning is that the .45LC is a very old black-powder cartridge which has relatively low pressure, whereas the .357 is a lot newer cartridge using modern gunpowder and a lot higher pressure. In both of these examples the smaller caliber bullet is more powerful because it has more and/or more powerful gunpowder propelling it.",2023-11-26 19:01:41,Success,normal,0.9998781681060791

Suppressors are one of the only places where it makes more sense given the legal BS, but even there more money often doesn&#039;t mean better but rather more specialized, whether that&#039;s &quot;better&quot; depends on use. Like, titanium stuff costs more, because titanium is just way way more of a pain in the dick to work with. And sure it saves weight, but titanium is LESS durable then steel let alone inconel. You generally don&#039;t want to let a Ti can get &gt;700°F. So a high end ti can will cost more and might be perfect on a hunting rifle where you really want to shave weight innawoods, but is actively the wrong material choice for range funz. Or with fancy 3D flow designs, which have real advantages in performance and backpressure, but that&#039;s worthless on a bolt and can be much harder to repair which then leads back to legal BS.<br><br>Then with stuff like sighting, there is no one right answer. LPVOs, fixed mag + RDS, holo+flip mag, all have their tradeoffs. Spending 10x the money on an LPVO doesn&#039;t radically change it either in terms of stuff like eye box, it just means nicer glass, less chromatic aberration etc. But you&#039;d be best off if thinking about it starting with a $300 swampfox because you may find you just don&#039;t like them and they don&#039;t fit your use cases.<br><br>Anyway not to rant, just saying you can end up with &quot;buy once cry anyway&quot; if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re after and &quot;buy ultra dirt cheap first&quot; sometimes is a good idea long term.

The thing&#039;s primarily value is in the fact that it allows a machine gun to operate without threat to an actual human, meaning it has absolute morale and won&#039;t balk even if bullets hit the rear of its fighting position.

Like taking your example, while you can get way with 8&quot; 300bo really does gain a solid amount from another 2&quot;, so 10&quot;. 6-8&quot; of can is very reasonable for 30cal, you might want to use supers sometimes as well, so you end up at or near 16&quot; combined anyway. Which is still much better, if you started at 16&quot; you&#039;d be at 22-24 or more. But if they&#039;re separate, what you have is two tax stamps, plus one of them is an SBR. If you want to take that to another state, you have to file travel permission forms.<br><br>Whereas if it&#039;s integral, the length of the can legally counts towards barrel length and OAL. 16&quot; barrel (8+8 or 9+7 or 10+6 or whatever) and 26&quot;+ OAL = one stamp, suppressor only, and suppressors and AOW are the only ones that don&#039;t require any sort of travel stuff.<br><br>How much this really matters beyond cool varies. If you live in a huge state like Texas and basically never take your guns elsewhere whatever.

Because this is a technology that absolutely everyone has to deal with. If beforehand we made fun of Russians for putting grills on their tanks, now we have to adapt and build similar devices in but in different configurations. There are three main ways to protect yourself from such things. The first is the timely detection and use of electronic warfare equipment, which is so powerful that it would make drones lose control, not only of the FPVs but also of other drones. The second way is to shoot them down by all possible means, which means using up ammunition. Even if you create some kind of barrage fire from a squad or platoon, you need to spend a lot of ammunition to shoot them down. And the third is the use of these so-called &quot;visors&quot;.<br>The russians have begun to install anti-drone superstructures and show them at the exhibition, and the troops have even started to use Kontakt-1 dynamic protection elements on top of tanks, on superstructures. They are trying to make the most of all the opportunities they have. Sooner or later, we will probably come to the same conclusion. We will use the same kind of polyamide nets, and we will cover not only the turret, but possibly the engine and transmission. And in the war between Hamas and the IDF we have already seen on Merkava IVs the same industrially produced or ad hoc roofs over tank turrets in order to protect the tanks from drone-dropped munitions or FPV drones. The main method will probably be to saturate the army with electronic warfare equipment, and it is desirable that each tank and IFV has an individual electronic warfare device.<br>7/x",2023-11-28 23:24:11,Success,normal,0.9999037981033325

Therefore, if we receive, say, a batch of Leopard 2A6 vehicles that can use this ammunition, it means that this ammunition will go to this particular brigade, to this tank battalion.

They had absolute fuck ton on recently obsolete 40mm AA guns in storage.

For instance Winchester RA9T is 990 fps, RA9B1 is 1010 fps and Federal HST 147 gr is 1000 fps. Anything under about 1070fps is subsonic a sea level, and these are very respectable defensive loads.<br><br>But I just meant try some cheap 147gr to see how quiet it can be, no sense blasting this expensive ammo<br><br><a href=""#p60279779"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;60279779</a><br>You&#039;ll have to work that out with your local FFL, but most will expect the gun to at least be in a shipping box (unsealed, so they can verify to log it in and out). But yeah, find a box that fits, bring the gun, shipping box and a printout of the receiving FFL and you&#039;ll be charged for the transfer if not also shipping.
